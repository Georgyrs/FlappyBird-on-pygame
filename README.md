# FlappyBird-on-pygame
This project is a Python implementation of the classic game "Flappy Bird" using the Pygame library. The game involves controlling a bird, navigating it through a series of pipes without colliding with them. The player earns points by successfully passing through pipes, and the game ends if the bird collides with any obstacles.
