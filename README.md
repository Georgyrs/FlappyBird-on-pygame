# Flappy Bird Clone

This project is a Python implementation of the classic game "Flappy Bird" using the Pygame library. The game involves controlling a bird, navigating it through a series of pipes without colliding with them. The player earns points by successfully passing through pipes, and the game ends if the bird collides with any obstacles.

## Key Features

- **Classic Gameplay**: Experience the nostalgic gameplay of the original Flappy Bird game.
- **Dynamic Backgrounds**: The game offers two background options: day and night, adding variation to the visual experience.
- **Responsive Controls**: Control the bird using simple mouse clicks to flap its wings and maneuver through the pipes.
- **Scoring System**: Keep track of your score as you navigate through the pipes. The game also stores and displays the player's highest score.
- **Sound Effects**: Enjoy immersive sound effects including bird flaps, collisions, and background music, enhancing the gaming experience.
- **Game Over Screen**: Upon collision with obstacles, the game displays a "Game Over" screen along with the player's score.
- **Restart Option**: Players can restart the game by clicking the mouse after a collision, allowing for quick replayability.
